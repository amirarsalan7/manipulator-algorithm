# manipulator algorithm Simulation in MATLAB Simulink

This repository contains simulations and models for **robotic manipulators** using **MATLAB Simulink**.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the **kinematic**, **dynamic**, and **control algorithms** of robot arms (manipulators) in a visual and modular way.
